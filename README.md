# DISASTER-PREDICTION-AND-ALERT-SYSTEM
Project Title:

Disaster Prediction and Alert System
Description:

Our project aims to develop a robust disaster prediction and alert system using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The system integrates both text-based and image-based SVM models to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness. Through this multimodal classification approach, we aim to democratize access to early warning and preparedness measures for natural calamities, empowering vulnerable communities and aiding disaster management authorities in timely response and mitigation efforts.
Features:

Multimodal Classification: Integration of text-based and image-based SVM models for comprehensive disaster analysis.
Democratized Access: Aimed at democratizing access to early warning and preparedness measures for natural calamities.
Empowerment: Empowering vulnerable communities and aiding disaster management authorities in timely response and mitigation efforts.
